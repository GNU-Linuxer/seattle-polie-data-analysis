    "## 1: Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As an international student in University of Washington, I am curious about the City of Seattle and would love to explore different city areas. By learning HCDE 410 and other data science classes in the UW, I am equipped with skills to analyze datasets and generate insights from them. Since I'm concerned about the city's public safety, I want to analyze its crime data to understand frequent crime types, in order to make me educated when going to different places. Research Question 2 is inspired from my past street-walking experience, especially when I'm walking in unfamiliar areas, as I'm concerned about whether it's more likely that a person attacks me or just wants my property (no personal harm if I comply).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I primarily reside in University District while studying in the UW, I want to learn the crime distribution in this area through study Question 3. Before COVID-19 pandemic that moves all UW classes online, I occasionally studied in UW libraries, where I discovered posters (from UW Police department) that urge students to protect their valuable items and never leave them unattended. In addition, I occasionally saw bikes (on bike rack) with missing parts, implying that an offender stole usable parts on students' bikes. "

    "## 2: Background and/or Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "While researching the Seattle Crime overview, I found [this US News article](https://realestate.usnews.com/places/washington/seattle/crime) describing that Seattle has \"a \\[relatively\\] lower crime rate than similarly sized metro areas\"; it has a higher rate of crimes against property and a lower rate of violent crimes (against people), comparing to the national average. Also, I learned that Seattle has a record high number of murder incidents in 2020, according to this [King5 news article](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle-police-reports-49-murders-setting-pace-for-record-homicides/281-c32aa4ae-ef9c-485f-a9d8-1113b491fc9d). Within the University of Washington; UW Police websites allow students to register [bicycles](https://bikeindex.org/uw) and [electronics](http://police.uw.edu/community-engagement/loveyourstuff/ereg/), and contents in these web pages describe the prevalence of thefts on them. Hence I assume that robbery/theft are the most frequent offense in the University District. Regarding how COVID-19 Pandemic affecting crime distribution, I remembered that attacks against people increases partially due to economic depression and discrimination against east Asian people (alleged origin of COVID-19).\n",
    "\n",
    "I have adjusted my research question 2, 3, and 4 according to my background research, as I want to use the actual crime data from Seattle Police Department to verify claims made in these articles. In addition, I can learn whether robbery/theft crimes is the most frequent offense in the University District, and whether this crime is noticeably more frequent than the second most popular crime in this UW area. All in all, I hope my final project is related to HCDE 410's lecture regarding open data science where readers can use raw data to audit claims made in analytical reports."
