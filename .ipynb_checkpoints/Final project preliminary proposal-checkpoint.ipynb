    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As an international student in University of Washington, I am curious about the City of Seattle and would love to explore different city areas. By learning HCDE 410 and other data science classes in the UW, I am equipped with skills to analyze datasets and generate insights from them. Since I'm concerned about the city's public safety, I want to analyze its crime data to understand frequent crime types, in order to make me educated when going to different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I primarily reside in University District while studying in the UW, I want to learn the crime distribution in this area through study question 3. Before COVID-19 pandemic that moves all UW classes online, I occationally study in UW libraries, where I discovered posters (from UW Police department) that urge students to protect their valuable items and never leave them unattended. In addition, I occationally saw bikes (on bike rack) with missing parts, implying that an offender stole usable parts on students' bikes. "
