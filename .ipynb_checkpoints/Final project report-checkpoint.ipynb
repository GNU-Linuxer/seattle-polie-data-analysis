    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In another data analysis programming class (pre-COVID), I overheard a project group doing cryptocurrency vs some kind of US stock index. While I had not seen the actual analysis (nor the report), this topic was suddenly brought to my mind when COVID-19 pandemic resulted in economic recessions that led to strange economic behaviors at several points throughout this pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrency popularity as an investment tool has noticeably increased, which is evident from the sheer increase of Bitcoin's value. Also, I presume that the US stock market was also affected by COVID-19 pandemic because the demand of many goods has changed noticeably and people refrain spending their money on non-essential goods/services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I decide to \"replicate\" the data analysis project. By incorporating data from pre-COVID time, I want to compare how the behavior/trend of US stock Indices (DJIA and S&P 500) correlates with cryptocurrency value in US Dollar (Bitcoin and Ethereum). For instance, what would be the implication of a rising US stock market on cryptocurrency."

    "## Background and/or Related Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the correlation between the US Stock market and cryptocurrency market is indeed a heated topic, as cryptocurrency (as an investment tool) is becoming more popular to the point that it poses challenges to the US Stock market's popularity. Since Bitcoin is the most influential cryptocurrency, most of the useful articles (that are worth including in this section) use Bitcoin instead of another cryptocurrency when comparing cryptocurrency to the US Stock market. However, articles provide conflicting viewpoints regarding such correlation. [This Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/05/13/bitcoin-and-stocks-correlation-reveal-a-secret/?sh=8a4a9ae12c2c) suggests a positive correlation between S&P 500 index and Bitcoin, and \"Bitcoin is going to be a valuable leading indicator for stocks\". In contrast, [a Market Watch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-bitcoins-relationship-with-the-stock-market-and-gold-looks-like-over-the-past-90-days-2019-08-21) views that Bitcoin behaves similar to gold market rather than US Stock market (using an ETF Trust that follows S&P 500 index value), and Bitcoin behaves inversely to the US Stock market, which indicate that Bitcoin is \"potentially being used as a safe-haven asset during global uncertainty in traditional markets\".\n",
    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant economic recession, I observed how more and more people began to invest in cryptocurrency, even they're just experimenting this new investment vehicle. There's [one journal article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40822-020-00154-1) that analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 and cryptocurrency value, it shows that cryptocurrencies value inversely correlates with COVID-19 cases and deaths during in early period of COVID-19 pandemic, but such correlation had become positive (direct correlation) at later pandemic stages. Bitcoin exhibits the strongest correlation value (both positively and negatively), while Ethereum and Ripple coins display a weaker correlation. The article's author hypothesized that people might invest in cryptocurrency in order to hedge economic uncertainties caused by COVID-19."

    "Pre-analysis data cleaning:\n",
    "\n",

    "The US Stock market closes on weekends and selected holidays, while the cryptocurrency market is open every day. In cryptocurrencies datasets, I will exclude all dates that is not present in the DJIA and S&P 500 dataset (two dataset have exact date as shown in the code block below), so I can better compare the stock market and cryptocurrency market.

    "**Step 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By producing five time series graphs on two stock indices and two cryptocurrencies (their price), my report will help readers to visually understand four dataset's general distribution and trend. Four graphs will depict the actual value of the dataset with respect to time, and one graph will describe the % change (compared to previous day) of all four dataset with respect to time. I choose not to combine the time series graph of actual value with respect to time due to the significant difference of range (the y-value) of four datasets. For instance, the daily DJIA value has 5 digits and daily S&P 500 value has only 4 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate whether US Stock indices values relates to cryptocurrency price, I will calculate the correlation on the % change of one US Stock index vs one cryptocurrency price, which will results a total of **four** correlation analysis:\n",
    "* DJIA vs Bitcoin\n",
    "* DJIA vs Etherum\n",
    "* S&P 500 vs Bitcoin\n",
    "* S&P 500 vs Etherum\n",

    "The result of correlation analysis will be presented in a table format.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the general correlation (if exists) may not be informative, I will calculate the number of days that two US Stock indices and two cryptocurrencies increase/decrease by 5-9%, 10-14%, 15-19%, and over 20%. Performing this analysis allows readers to compare the overall increase/decrease of US Stock market and cryptocurrency market, and interpret whether the tallied value between number of days (of two markets) can be viewed as similar. I will produce a bar chart where x-axis is the percentage increase/decrease and y-axis is the number of days with such x-value. In addition, each bar color denotes one dataset.\n",
