    "## 1: Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As an international student in University of Washington, I am curious about the City of Seattle and would love to explore different city areas. By learning HCDE 410 and other data science classes in the UW, I am equipped with skills to analyze datasets and generate insights from them. Since I'm concerned about the city's public safety, I want to analyze its crime data to understand frequent crime types, in order to make me educated when going to different places. Research Question 2 is inspired from my past street-walking experience, especially when I'm walking in unfamiliar areas, as I'm concerned about whether it's more likely that a person attacks me or just wants my property (no personal harm if I comply).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I primarily reside in University District while studying in the UW, I want to learn the crime distribution in this area through study Question 3. Before COVID-19 pandemic that moves all UW classes online, I occasionally studied in UW libraries, where I discovered posters (from UW Police department) that urge students to protect their valuable items and never leave them unattended. In addition, I occasionally saw bikes (on bike rack) with missing parts, implying that an offender stole usable parts on students' bikes. "

    "## 2: Background and/or Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "While researching the Seattle Crime overview, I found [this US News article](https://realestate.usnews.com/places/washington/seattle/crime) describing that Seattle has \"a \\[relatively\\] lower crime rate than similarly sized metro areas\"; it has a higher rate of crimes against property and a lower rate of violent crimes (against people), comparing to the national average. Also, I learned that Seattle has a record high number of murder incidents in 2020, according to this [King5 news article](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle-police-reports-49-murders-setting-pace-for-record-homicides/281-c32aa4ae-ef9c-485f-a9d8-1113b491fc9d). Within the University of Washington; UW Police websites allow students to register [bicycles](https://bikeindex.org/uw) and [electronics](http://police.uw.edu/community-engagement/loveyourstuff/ereg/), and contents in these web pages describe the prevalence of thefts on them. Hence I assume that robbery/theft are the most frequent offense in the University District. Regarding how COVID-19 Pandemic affecting crime distribution, I remembered that attacks against people increases partially due to economic depression and discrimination against east Asian people (alleged origin of COVID-19).\n",
    "\n",
    "I have adjusted my research question 2, 3, and 4 according to my background research, as I want to use the actual crime data from Seattle Police Department to verify claims made in these articles. In addition, I can learn whether robbery/theft crimes is the most frequent offense in the University District, and whether this crime is noticeably more frequent than the second most popular crime in this UW area. All in all, I hope my final project is related to HCDE 410's lecture regarding open data science where readers can use raw data to audit claims made in analytical reports."

    "## 7: Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I hypothesized that personal assault crimes would increase after 2020-01-01, but the Seattle crime dataset shows that the number of monthly assault offenses does not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a record-high 6513 fraud offenses in May, 2020; the number is much larger than any other offenses at any time. Observing the sharp increase of fraud offense after 2020-01-01, the time when COVID-19 Pandemic had become evident in the US, I remembered how scammers attempts to file fake unemployment benefit claims using other people's identity, according to a newsletter in the UW Information School mailing list. While researching more news articles that analyzes this situation, I discovered [a Deloitte article](https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/financial-advisory/articles/covid-19-operating-in-the-new-normal-fraud-risk.html) describing the US economic depression, the increased unemployment rate, and the lack of information security during companies' transition to remote working all provide excellent opportunities for perpetrators to commit fraud schemes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Political events, such as George Floyd's death and subsequent violent protests, contribute to other property-destruction related offenses after 2020-01-01, and people's financial instability due to job loss might encourage them to commit property thefts, resulting a higher overall crime offenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is statistically significant to conclude that (in most calendar days) total crimes against property outnumbered crimes against person, which confirms [this US News article's analysis](https://realestate.usnews.com/places/washington/seattle/crime) on Seattle crime distribution. The original crime dataset categorize fraud, bribery and several offenses that are loosely related to robbery/theft as crimes against property. Some readers (including me) consider crimes against property as robbery-related offenses that damages/steals civilians' personal properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis confirms with my hypothesis that larceny/robbery crimes happen most frequently in the University District (there are 3346 days having highest number of larceny/robbery offense counts), and this offense type outnumbers other offenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing original dataset regarding Seattle's annual homicide counts reveals that Seattle **do** have a record-high homicide count in 2020, which confirms with [King5 news article's](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle-police-reports-49-murders-setting-pace-for-record-homicides/281-c32aa4ae-ef9c-485f-a9d8-1113b491fc9d) claim. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Crime classification is subjective, and one person may categorize a crime differently than another person.\n",
    "* Crime offenses that are subsequently acquitted may not be removed from this dataset, resulting in a higher number of crime entries than actual prosecutable offenses.\n",
    "* Civil right activists may question Seattle Police Department's biased policing against people with color, although I could not find firm evidences that support this claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unknown and dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Seattle Crime dataset may not contain all crimes that actually happened in the city. The website stated that only finalized (UCR approved) reports are published in this dataset. Those in draft, awaiting approval, or completed after the update may be published at a later date.\n",
    "* When crime investigation proceeds further, crime entries may be retroactively added, updated, or removed, which may result in change of historical data when readers re-run my Jupyter notebook program at a later date.\n",
    "* This dataset does not include committed crimes that are not yet discovered/found out by any police department.\n",
    "* Many crimes are reported after crime offenses, and the offense date & time may not be accurate.\n",
    "* University District covers a larger area than the UW itself (even though this district is very related to the UW community), and some readers may disagree with this geographical scope set by Seattle Police Department."

    "## 8: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the Seattle Crime Dataset (from Seattle Police Department) informed me the overall distribution of crime activities in Seattle and University of Washington. Additionally, findings from this analysis project makes me more vigilant on protecting my property while going out to different locations in Seattle (especially when I am walking on the street in unfamiliar locations). Result from this data analysis encourages readers to take extra care on their properties while in Seattle, and especially be vigilant on fraud attempts. Moreover, these findings helps people in the University of Washington area to aware thefts on their laptop computers and other valuable items. Finally, observing a record-high homicide offense counts in 2020 encouraged me to consider possible causes of this social issue. "
